    <div class="content">
      <p>Have ever found yourself unable to use a product or service meant for “everyone”? Think about a tall building and you need to get to the top but there’s no elevator. There is no easy way to climb up the stairs if the person is pregnant, motivationally dispossessed, in a wheelchair or with a sprained ankle. The issue does not lie within the person but rather within the design. A public area isn’t unrestricted if only selected people are able to access it yet, many products and services are designed to serve all yet only actually work for some. Inclusive design tackles this issue by specifically targeting people who are marginalized and still satisfies everyone else’s needs.</p>
      <h3>Why do we need Inclusive Design?</h3>
      <p>Both Inclusive Design and Universal Design are built and designed for everyone and they have many similarities. However, one way to differentiate the two is: Universal Design attempts to find one solution that works for everyone while Inclusive Design find a solution that is changeable.

        The problems that the marginalized face can be experienced by anyone. For example, an app that relies on drag-and-drop interaction does not satisfy the needs of a screen reader user or someone with a broken wrist. In this case the person with a broken wrist is facing the same issue as a person who uses a screen reader albeit one may be temporary. If the design was created considering this issue, this problem would not have arisen; problems that can be encountered by anyone. </p>
